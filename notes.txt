DEV
 - better attributes for testing and readability
  - data-test-id
  - improve id in general (random strings)

UX
 - Too much is going on on landing page
   - Two same link in viewport
   - LP image seems quite disconnected from the offered product 
 - Privacy settings icon wont go away on mobile
 - Not optimized dark mode
   - Some missing artefacts on images (as they won't change color from black)
   - Also some other colors aren't converted, so the site in DM looks uninteresting
     - For instance active checkboxes on Contact sales page
     - Or arrows to expand menu in footer section
  - Only few links on Whitepapers page. At least date shouldn't be visible (8 articles over 5 years doesn't look good)

UI
 - Footer has miss-aligned links on mobile 
 - Missing first pricing table? (https://usercentrics.com/in-app-sdk/)
 - Pricing table to horizontal scroll (as products above)
   - As on mobile and on tablets
Improvements
  - I like the color combination, but some main CTR buttons merging with background
    - Start free/Explore demo as they have the same color as bg (https://usercentrics.com/website-consent-management/)
  - Support images in 'solutions' section are quite bland (https://usercentrics.com/website-consent-management/)
    - Also those images are reused across other products (Web CMP, ctv CMP, PMP)
    - Why black design for those product pages while others are more into white bg
  - Too big font in currency dropdown
  - Make horizontal carousels scrollable on desktop (good while using touchpad)
  - Search: customer -> case study trusted shops (404 https://usercentrics.com/partner-integrations/trusted-shops/)
